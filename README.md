# colordistance 1.1.1

Publication: <https://peerj.com/articles/6398/>

An R package with functions for quantifying the differences between colorful objects. Loads and displays images, selectively masks specified background
colors, bins pixels by color using either data-dependent or automatically
generated color bins, quantitatively measures color similarity among images
using one of several distance metrics for comparing pixel color clusters, and
clusters images by object color similarity. Originally written for use with
organism coloration (reef fish color diversity, butterfly mimicry, etc), but
easily applicable for any image set.

# News

**March 18, 2021**: Minor updates to do with `spatstat` package (a sub-package, `spatstat.geom`, is now required instead). This shouldn't affect installation or usage.

**November 11, 2020**: Transparencies (alpha channel) can now be used to mask image backgrounds. By default, the presence of transparent pixels in a PNG overrides other background parameters, and the transparent pixels are ignored as background. This behavior can be disabled by setting `alpha.channel = FALSE` in any function that takes an image path as an argument. This allows users to specify the background in an image without having to decide on a background color that is sufficiently different from the object of interest. Backgrounds of uniform color can easily be rendered transparent using Photoshop, ImageJ, or GIMP.

**February 19, 2020**: Thanks to Evelyn Taylor-Cox for pointing out a bug with `getLabHist` when specifying `a.bounds` and `b.bounds`, resulting in bins that did not sum to 1. The bug should now be fixed in the development version!

**February 6, 2019**: Our methods paper for `colordistance` is out in PeerJ! Find it here: <https://peerj.com/articles/6398/>. 

**December 27, 2018**: Fixed a bug when converting color clusters using convertColorSpace.

**July 10, 2018**: Added `scatter3dclusters` function to plot clusters in color space, scaled according to their size and colored according to their color. This is helpful for visualizing the distributions that `colordistance` actually compares to come up with a distance matrix, since the histograms can give the misleading impression that the clusters are treated as one-dimensional after binning. Also tweaked some compatibilities.

**June 26, 2018**: Added option to perform analyses CIELAB color space, as well as warnings about perceptual non-uniformity of RGB space. RGB (with warning) is still the default in order to prompt users to read up on CIELAB before using it. See "Color Spaces" and "CIELab Analyses" vignettes.

**April 19, 2018**: Functions for combining data across a set of images (`combineClusters` and `combineList`) added. Useful for pooling multiple images of the same individual, species, etc before analysis.

**Input**: Set(s) of JPEG or PNG images of colorful objects, optionally with backgrounds masked out.

**Output**: Color clusters, visualizations for color binning and image similarity, and distance matrices quantifying color similarity between images.

**Requirements**: R >= 3.3.2

## Installation

The development version of `colordistance` can be found at <https://github.com/hiweller/colordistance>.

To install the development version of `colordistance` in R:

1. Install the `devtools` package (`install.packages("devtools")`).

2. Install `colordistance` *without* vignettes (long-form documentation) to save time and space or *with* vignettes for offline access to help documents.

    ```R
    # Without vignettes
    devtools::install_github("hiweller/colordistance")

    # With vignettes
    devtools::install_github("hiweller/colordistance", build_vignettes=TRUE)
    ```
 3. You can access help documents by running `help(package="colordistance")` and clicking on the html files or, if you set `build_vignettes=TRUE` during install, run `vignette("colordistance-introduction")`.

To install the stable release version on CRAN (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=colordistance), just run `install.packages("colordistance")`.

## Documentation

All of the `colordistance` vignettes that (optionally) come with the package are also available online at <https://hiweller.github.io/colordistance/>. I recommend reading at least the introduction before getting started.

* [Introduction to `colordistance`](https://hiweller.github.io/colordistance/colordistance-introduction.html)

* [Explanation of color spaces](https://hiweller.github.io/colordistance/color-spaces.html)

* [Explanation of pixel binning methods](https://hiweller.github.io/colordistance/binning-methods.html)

* [Explanation of color distance metrics](https://hiweller.github.io/colordistance/color-metrics.html)

* [CIE Lab analyses](https://hiweller.github.io/colordistance/lab-analyses.html)

## Quickstart

To get started with `colordistance`, you'll need:

1. A set of images of objects you want to compare, ideally as consistent with each other as possible in terms of lighting and angle, and with anything you want to ignore [masked out with a uniform background color](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/5446/making-the-background-of-an-image-transparent-in-gimp). Need something to get started? Try [these butterflyfish photos](https://github.com/hiweller/butterflyfish)! `colordistance` also comes with an example set of *Heliconius* butterfly pictures from [Meyer, 2006](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040341), which you can access via `system.file("extdata", "Heliconius", package="colordistance")` in R.

2. R version 3.3.2 or later.

3. Estimates for the upper and lower RGB bounds for your background color. R reads in pixels channels with a 0-1 intensity range instead of the typical 0-255 (so pure red would be [1, 0, 0], green would be [0, 1, 0], blue would be [0, 0, 1], and so on). Background masking is rarely perfect, so you'll need to specify an upper and lower threshold for the background cutoff - around 0.2 usually does it. So if your background is white, your lower threshold would be [0.8, 0.8, 0.8] and your upper would be [1, 1, 1]. The default background color for `colordistance` is bright green, [0, 1, 0].

To run an analysis with all the default settings (bright green background masking, RGB color histograms with 3 bins per channel, and earth mover's distance for color distance metric -- see documentation), just run:

```R
colordistance::imageClusterPipeline("path/to/images/folder")
```

You'll get a blue and yellow heatmap with a cluster dendrogram and labels taken from the image names. Yellow cells correspond to *dissimilar* images; blue cells correspond to more *similar* images. If those scores don't look right, try changing the number of bins (`bins` argument), the distance metric (`distanceMethod` argument), and making sure you're masking out the right background color.

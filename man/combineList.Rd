\title{Combine a list of cluster features into a single cluster set}
\usage{
combineList(hist_list, method = "mean")
}
\arguments{
\item{hist_list}{A list of cluster dataframes as returned by
\code{\link{getHistList}}.}

\item{method}{Method for combining color histograms. Default is
\code{"mean"}, but other generic functions (\code{"median"}, \code{"sum"},
etc) will work. String is evaluated using \code{"eval"} so any appropriate
R function is accepted.}
}
\description{
Combine a list of cluster features as returned by \code{\link{getHistList}}
according to the specified method.
}
\note{
While the function can also accept clusters generated using kmeans
  (\code{\link{getKMeansList}} followed by \code{\link{extractClusters}}),
  this is not recommended, as kmeans does not provide explicit analogous
  pairs of clusters, and clusters are combined by row number (all row 1
  clusters are treated as analogous, etc). Color histograms are appropriate
  because the bins are defined the same way for each image.

\examples{
hist_list <- getHistList(system.file("extdata", "Heliconius/Heliconius_A",
package="colordistance"), lower=rep(0.8, 3), upper=rep(1, 3))
median_clusters <- combineList(hist_list, method="median")
